Why is there always someone on the Colorado Rockies with a mullet? Are there not enough memes and public service announcements out there? #nlwildcard #laughingatyou
Strikeout. One away for Strop. Top 9. #Cubs #NLWildcard
How many innings this game going? #NLWildCard #CubsVsRockies
#NLWildCard uniform code in MLB? Strop put the the lid on right.
THE CROOKED HAT IS BACK BABY! Big K! #NLWildCard #EverybodyIn
RT @ WTF? Butera was CLEARLY safe. Rockies just got fucked. I'm starting to get the feeling that the fix is in. Really hope I'm wrong. #NLWildCard
That wasn't the 8th inning of a Cubs #Postseason game.  It was the 1/x of an 8th inning of a #Cubs playoff game. #NLWildCard
Pedro Strop looks to be on the good stuff. #CubsVsRockies #NLWildCard #MLB
Is it just me, or does Gore look like he’s twelve years old? #NLWildCard
I love/hate October baseball #NLWildCard #EverbodyIn
Not sure who's more pro-Cubs at the moment; the ESPN announce team or the umps? #NLWildCard
RT @ Javy Baez, you are unreal my friend! #Cubs #NLWildCard https://t.co/WkUZHDcda6
I think the game is decided by whether the Rockies score here. #NLWildCard
Yet again, LOL @ any sportswriter who wants to do away with the Wild Card Game. This is fantastic; only problem with it is it started at 8 instead of 7 like all games should. #NLWildCard
Tonight’s #NLWildCard game reminded me the @Braves basically turned Jason Hayward into Dansby and Ender and saved a lot of money.
Time for Pedro to show his true colors... #NLWildCard
Oh good at least joe has Wilson up in the pen  #NLWildCard
This game is getting intense for both the Cubs and the Rockies. #NLWildCard
Pedro Strop wears his hat like he's modeling for a 1998 Ecko Unlimited Ad. #NLWildCard
RT @ Right-handed batters were 0-for-26 with 18 K's this season against Adam Ottavino's slider when located Down &amp; Away until Baez's double.  #Cubs #Rockies #NLWildCard
How can the Rockies "Respect Me!!" "Respect Me!!" Anthony Rizzo if the @Cubs take him out of the game? #NLWildCard
RT @ Even @espn commentators mocking umps bias toward @Cubs #NLWildCard
RT @ Please god tell me how this is an out!? This is ridiculous  #NLWildCard @MLB https://t.co/UhVconjL9c
Did @jessmendoza just say “both teams wanting it at the end of the night?” Deep. #NLWildCard
RT @ Numbers don’t lie... Adam Ottavino’s #Rapsodo #Pitchdesign off-season work produced results this season! 🔥👀 @statcast #NLWildCard https://t.co/B8iS8GDk7m

@Cubs Hey don't the umps just award a run to the cubs no reason and call this game over? Been doing it all game. #NLwildcard
It really pays off to be a Cubby in a Wrigley town bar at this moment. 🤞🏻 #NLWildCard
That slider from Strop is about as nasty as it gets. #NLWildCard
Javy Baez come through with a clutch two-out hit to tie up the #NLWildCard game against the #Rockies. 👀🔥 #Cubs   🎥: #MLB https://t.co/LE5SV7Ijm0
I hope Strop gets rocked. Put your hat on right.  You look stupid!! #gorockies #NLWildCard
My word, I have missed Pedro Strop so hard. #cubs #EverybodyIn #NLWildCard

#NLWildCard Why oh why would Ottavino throw anything even close to a strike up in the count 0-2 with an undisciplined hitter like Baez up there hacking?  COLvsCHC smh
The broadcaster bias just makes me root for the @Rockies even more. #NLWildCard
Terrace Gore looks like a baby. And I love him. #Cubs #NLWildCard #EverybodyIn
