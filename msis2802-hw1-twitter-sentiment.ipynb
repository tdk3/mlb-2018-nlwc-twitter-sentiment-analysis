    "18K tweets about the NL Wildcard game between the Chicago Cubs and the Colorado Rockies were collected in the 8th inning. The game was tied 1-1 at that point with very little action. My initial thought was that positive sentiment would be high since fans were probably excited about the game. However, the scores show that negative sentiment was greater than positive and the neutral or \"objective\" sentiment was far higher. Generally, this does make some degree of sense since many tweets involve describing something seen in the game. The negative sentiment outweighing the positive could be explained by the fact that the game had little action and thus, less material for fans to react positively too. Low scoring games may have things that trigger overwhemlingly negative reactions like stranded runners, flyouts, or errors.\n",
